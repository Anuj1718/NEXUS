<!-- search react cdn on google and copy the link of react and react-dom and paste it in the script tag -->

<!-- 2 separate script tags for react and react-dom because both are different libraries one is for creating components and other is for rendering components to the DOM -->
<!-- react native devs can use react but not react-dom because they are not rendering to the DOM  -->
