In CSS, the `background-size` and `background-repeat` properties control how background images are displayed within an element.

**`background-size`** determines the dimensions of the background image:

- **`auto`**: Displays the image at its original size.
- **`cover`**: Scales the image to cover the entire element, possibly cropping it to maintain aspect ratio.
- **`contain`**: Scales the image to fit within the element without cropping, ensuring the entire image is visible.
- **Specific dimensions**: You can specify exact sizes using units like pixels (`px`), percentages (`%`), or other CSS units. For example:


  background-size: 100px 50px; /* width: 100px, height: 50px */
  /* background-size: 50% auto;   width: 50% of the element's width, height: auto */

/* 
**`background-repeat`** controls how the background image repeats within the element:

- **`repeat`**: Repeats the image both horizontally and vertically (default behavior).
- **`repeat-x`**: Repeats the image horizontally only.
- **`repeat-y`**: Repeats the image vertically only.
- **`no-repeat`**: Displays the image once without repeating.
- **`space`**: Repeats the image as many times as possible without clipping, distributing any extra space evenly between the images.
- **`round`**: Repeats the image as many times as possible without clipping, and if there's extra space, it scales the images slightly to fit perfectly without gaps.

By combining these properties, you can control the appearance and behavior of background images to achieve the desired design effect. */
