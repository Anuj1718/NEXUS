<!-- Below are the general rules regarding the content allowed inside a paragraph element (<p>) and how browsers handle disallowed content:

  - **Permitted Content of a `<p>` Element:**  
    - According to the HTML specification (and as noted on MDN), a `<p>` element’s content model is defined as *phrasing content*.  
    - *Phrasing content* includes text and inline-level elements (for example, `<span>`, `<a>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<img>`, and similar tags) that mark up text at the word or character level.
  
  - **Disallowed Content in a `<p>` Element:**  
    - Block-level elements (such as `<div>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<h1>–<h6>`, etc.) are not allowed as children of a `<p>` element.  
    - If you attempt to place a block-level element inside a `<p>`, the HTML parser will automatically close the `<p>` tag before encountering that block-level element. This means the block-level element ends up outside the `<p>`, even if your source code appears nested.
  
  - **CSS Selector Implications:**  
    - Because of the automatic closing of the `<p>` element, any CSS rules like `p > div` or `p div` will not work as expected. There will be no `<div>` inside the `<p>` in the Document Object Model (DOM), so such selectors won’t match.
    - In contrast, using a structure such as:
    
      <div>
        <p>Hello Coders</p>
      </div>

      is valid because a `<div>` (which can contain block-level elements) properly wraps the `<p>`.
  
  - **Key Takeaway:**  
    - **Always remember:** The `<p>` element is intended solely for text and inline (phrasing) content. Use block-level containers like `<div>` for grouping larger sections or blocks of content.  
    - When invalid nesting occurs (for example, `<p><div>...</div></p>`), the browser’s auto-correction alters the DOM structure, leading to CSS selectors that no longer match your intended elements.
  
  These rules are set by the HTML standard to ensure that content is semantically correct and that browsers render pages consistently.  
    
Similarly like p tag, it is for h1-h6 tags

Inline elements are allowed as child in block elements, but not block elements in block tags like p, h1-h6

Elements like <div>, <section>, and <article> are flexible containers that can hold both block-level and inline elements. The restriction is specific to certain elements (like <p> and headings) whose content models are designed for text and inline content only.

  In list, i cannot have any child other than li as block element, then later on inside li, i can have. 

  The HTML specification requires that the direct children of a <ul> (unordered list) or <ol> (ordered list) be <li> elements. This means that you should not include other tags (like <div>, <p>, or <span>) as direct children of these list containers.

    If you need to include other types of content (such as a <div> or <p>), you must first wrap that content in an <li>. For example:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <div>This div is inside an li, which is valid.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>This paragraph is inside an li, which is valid.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>



      Summary of the Nesting  Rules
Block Elements → Inline Elements:
Block-level elements (like <div>, <section>, <p>—when permitted, as in the case of <div>) can include inline elements.

Inline Elements → Inline Elements:
Inline elements are allowed to contain other inline elements and text.

Inline Elements → Block Elements:
As a general rule, block-level elements should not be placed directly inside inline elements (with the rare HTML5 exception of the <a> element’s transparent content model).

Special Cases:
Certain block-level elements (like <p> and headings) are specifically designed to hold only inline (phrasing) content and will cause the browser to auto-correct the markup if you try to insert a block-level element inside them.

These guidelines help maintain valid HTML markup and ensure that browsers render content consistently. -->
