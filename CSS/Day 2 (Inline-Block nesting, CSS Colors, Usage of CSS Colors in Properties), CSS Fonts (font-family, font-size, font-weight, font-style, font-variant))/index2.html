CSS Colors :

1) Named colours : predefined color names such as red, blue, green

p {
  color: red;
}


2) Hexadecimal Notation : Colors can be specified using a hexadecimal value(0-0, a-f). It can be in the 6-digit format (#RRGGBB) (4+4+4+4+4+4 = 24 bits) or the shorthand 3-digit format (#RGB

p {
  color: #ff0000;   /* Red */
}
First two bits represent Red, next two green, next two blue


3) RGB and RGBA Functions: 

      a)RGB: Defines a color by its red, green, and blue components (values from 0 to 255) (24 bits ( 8 + 8 + 8) )
      p {
        color: rgb(255, 0, 0);  /* Red */
      }
      as from 8 bits, we can represent 256 values (0-255), so 8 bits for each of the three colors gives us a total of 24 bits for RGB. (2^8 = 256, so 256 * 256 * 256 = 16,777,216 possible colors)
          

      b)RGBA: Adds an alpha channel (opacity) as the fourth value, which ranges from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque)

      p {
        color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);  /* Semi-transparent red */
      }

      Similarly, can add alpha in hexadecimal format too, eg)  #ff0000ff; last two digits ff occupying 8 bits represents complete opaque
        AA represents the alpha channel (opacity) in the same 0–FF range.
        For example, FF means 255 (completely opaque) and 00 means 0 (completely transparent).
      
4) HSL and HSLA Functions:

      a)HSL: Defines a color using hue (degrees on the color wheel), saturation (percentage), and lightness (percentage).

      p {
        color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%);  /* Red */
      }

      b)HSLA: Similar to HSL but with an added alpha (opacity) value.

      p {
        color: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5);  /* Semi-transparent red */
      }


      Hue: (color type)
         Hue refers to the base color or shade. It is represented as an angle on a color wheel, typically ranging from 0° to 360°. For example, 0° (or 360°) is red, 120° is green, and 240° is blue. Adjusting the hue rotates the color around the wheel.

      Saturation: (intensity of color)
        Saturation determines the intensity or purity of the color. It is expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%. A saturation of 0% means the color is completely desaturated (resulting in a shade of gray), while 100% gives the full, pure color. Lower saturation results in a more washed-out or muted appearance.

      Lightness: (darkness or lightness of color)
        Lightness controls how light or dark the color appears, also expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%. A lightness of 0% is completely dark (black), 100% is completely light (white), and 50% is typically the “normal” brightness of the color. Increasing the lightness makes the color appear closer to white, while decreasing it makes the color appear closer to black.


        Usage of CSS Colors in CSS Properties: 


       1) Text Color:
            The color property sets the foreground (text) color.


            body {
              color: #333; /* Dark gray text */
            }
          
       2) Background Color:
            The background-color property sets the background color of an element.


            .box {
              background-color: lightblue;
            }
              .box{
              background-image :url('./image.jpg');
              background-color will be applied if image is not loaded or is not available, so that the text is still visible.
              background-size: cover; /* This will make the image cover the entire box */
              background-repeat: no-repeat; /* This will prevent the image from repeating */ means that the image will not be tiled, it will only be shown once.

        3) Border Colors, Shadow Colors, Etc.:
            Many other CSS properties accept color values, such as border-color, box-shadow, and text-shadow.

            .bordered {
              border: 2px solid #000; /* Black border */
            } -->
