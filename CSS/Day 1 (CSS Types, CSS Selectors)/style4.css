/* Select By Descendent */

/* 
This applies to all <p> elements that are inside a <section>, no matter how deeply nested they are.
Both first and second <p> elements will turn blue. */



/* Select by Child */
section > p{
  color: blueviolet;
}

/* This only applies to <p> elements that are direct children of a <section>.
It does not apply to <p> elements inside <div> elements. */
/* Since only the second <p> is a direct child of <section>, it turns blueviolet, while the first <p> remains blue (due to the previous rule). */
