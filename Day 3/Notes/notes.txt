Absolute path vs Relative path:

absolute path valid for everyone (to send letters)
relative path kisi ek jagah se valid

nexus: day1, day2 => Third.png, day3=> xyz.png

if in day 3 folder,
img src="xyz.png" not recommended
img src="./xyz.png" 
to go one level up i.e to nexus, use 2 dots, img src="../Day2/Third.png"

if there was a folder above nexus too, so would have used ../.. to go in it

to go 1 level below, use /
to go 1 level above, use ../

this was relative address

mac : ls
windows : dir(directory)

cd : change drive
cd .. : to go one level down/up

C:\Users\Anuj\Desktop\NEXUS\NEXUS\Day 2 absolute path

mac uses / arrow

root directory in windows : C
in mac : /

absolute path is wrt root directory

We can not use absolute path in the img src tag to access the image, if client and server are different machines, you do not wanna provide server with full access to your machine.
Bahar ki HTML file internal structure padh legi, will lead to security concerns. I do not wanna give my root directory(folder jaha se starting hoti hai) access to anyone.

But here you have the same client and server, you can only access the files of the folder you opened in VsCode not outside it.

Bhale hi server bahar ho ya machine ke andar, you won't be allowed to access the files outside of the folder, as HTML file to bahar ki hi hai
