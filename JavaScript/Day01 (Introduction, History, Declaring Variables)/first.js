// The first web browser ever built was WorldWideWeb, created in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.
// Later it was renamed Nexus to avoid confusion with the World Wide Web itself.

//Netscape was one of the most important early web browsers and a key player in early internet history.
//JavaScript was created inside Netscape in 1995 by Brendan Eich, during the race to make web pages interactive.

// ECMA : to standardize JS
// ECMAScript is the standardized specification that JavaScript is based on. 
// It defines the core features and syntax of the language, ensuring consistency across different implementations.

// each browser has its own JS engine
// V8 - Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge
// SpiderMonkey - Mozilla Firefox
// JavaScriptCore (Nitro) - Apple Safari
// V8 made in c++

//jit is just in time compiler
// It improves performance by compiling code on the fly, rather than ahead of time.

// Node.js is an open-source JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JS outside the browser—onservers, desktops, and more. It uses Chromeʼs V8 engine for execution andprovides additional APIs to interact with files, networking, and OS resource management.
