zomato is displaying data from backend server
inspect -> network -> fetch/xhr-> then refresh-> home (check which has ur info) -> response
u can read this object urself

the data that is coming from backend is an object too and we should be able to display it on frontend
api se data fetch kar lenge?
zomato, swiggy apis are encrypted
we cant use them directly
we will use mock api
mock api -> json server
