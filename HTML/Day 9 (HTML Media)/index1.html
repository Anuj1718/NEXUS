  <!-- In the `<iframe>` tag you provided:

    1. **`frameborder="0"`**  
       - This attribute controls the border around the embedded frame.  
       - A value of `0` means **no border** will be displayed.  
       - Although `frameborder` is an older attribute (deprecated in HTML5), some browsers still support it.
    
    2. **`allowfullscreen`**  
       - This attribute allows the embedded content (in this case, a YouTube video) to be played in **full-screen mode** when the user clicks the fullscreen button.  
       - If omitted, the fullscreen option might not be available.  
       - It does not need a value; just including it enables the feature. -->
  
       <!-- iframe does not have "controls" as youtube does not wanna give full access (like they wanna show ads), also not all websites support youtube videos to be embedded or their own  videos to be displayed. -->
