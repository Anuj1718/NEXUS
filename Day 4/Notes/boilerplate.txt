UTF-8, short for Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit, is a character encoding standard that enables the representation of Unicode characters in a single byte string. It's widely used in web development, being the default encoding in HTML5 and often used in text processing and encoding. UTF-8 efficiently encodes characters using a variable number of bytes, with a maximum of four bytes per character. This makes it an efficient and compatible encoding scheme, supporting a vast range of languages and characters, while being backwards compatible with ASCII.
